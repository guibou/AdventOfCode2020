My advent of code for 2020

Each days are in `src/DayN.hs`.

`src/DayX.hs` is the template to start each day, you can generate a new file using `src/startDay X`.

Starts stack with `nix-shell --run 'cabal new-repl'` to start a session and `:l YourDay`. You can also use `direnv` and everything will be setup automagically.

`Utils` contains a shitload of utils ;)
